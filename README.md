# CMtools-docs
This repo contains the documentation for the text mining tools developed by ContentMine.

The idea is to use https://readthedocs.org/ to produce the documentation for each tool. We would point to this documentation after demonstrating the tools in workshops/webinars/etc.

A tutorial to do this is found here:
